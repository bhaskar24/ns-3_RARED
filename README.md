# Extending RED qdisc in nsÂ­3 to support Refined Adaptive RED (RARED) algorithm
Course Code: CS822

Assignment: #GP6

Refined Adaptive RED (RARED) [1] is an extension of ARED [2]. It inherits all the properities of ARED but with a minor improvement in adaptive setting of Pmax. This repository contains an implementation of RARED in ns-3 [3].
